ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF CVE-2025-36911 (WhisperPair)

This Software implements techniques described in the WhisperPair research
(https://whisperpair.eu), which was responsibly disclosed to Google in August
2025 under a 150-day coordinated disclosure window. Google classified this
vulnerability as Critical severity and worked with ecosystem partners to
release patches before public disclosure.

This reference implementation is released after:
1. The disclosure window has closed
2. Patches have been made available by affected manufacturers
3. The vulnerability has been publicly documented (CVE-2025-36911)
4. Extensive media coverage has informed the public

The purpose of this release is to enable:
- Security researchers to understand and study the vulnerability
- Device manufacturers to verify their patches
- Penetration testers to assess client environments (with authorization)
- Educators to teach about Bluetooth security
